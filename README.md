## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a **secure web-based appointment system** using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implement strong **authentication and authorization mechanisms**
- Protect sensitive patient data using **modern security controls**
- Improve operational efficiency for dental staff and administrators
- Provide a **user-friendly experience** for patients, dentists, and staff

## 🔐 Key Security Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Access permissions based on user roles (Admin, Dentist, Staff, Patient)
  - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**
  - Protects data during transmission
  - Ensures confidentiality of appointment and patient information

- **Password Hashing (BCRYPT)**
  - Secure storage of credentials using PHP `password_hash()`
  - Prevents password exposure even if database is compromised

- **Input Validation**
  - Prevents SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Ensures data integrity and application stability

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
  - Adds an extra security layer during login
  - Protects privileged accounts from unauthorized access

- **Secure Database Authorization**
  - Restricts read/write operations based on user roles
  - Centralized and controlled access to patient records
